# QA Automation Test LIBREA.COM

## Introduction
This repository contains an automated quality assurance (QA) test framework designed to streamline the testing process of your software applications. With this framework, you can write and run automated tests to ensure the functionality and reliability of your software.

## Features
- Easy-to-use and customizable test scripts.
- Support for various test types, including functional, regression, and performance testing.
- Integration with popular testing libraries and tools (e.g., Selenium, JUnit, TestNG).
- Detailed reporting and logging to track test results and identify issues.
- Continuous integration support for automated test execution.

Base Test Description

## Overview
The "Base Test" serves as the foundation for all automated test cases within our QA automation framework. It establishes the essential environment setup, configurations, and common test steps that are shared among various test scenarios.

## Purpose
The purpose of the "Base Test" is to:
- Ensure consistent setup and teardown of the testing environment.
- Provide a centralized location for common configurations (e.g., browser settings, user authentication).
- Reduce duplication of code and promote code reusability across test cases.

## Key Components
1. **Environment Setup**: This includes initializing the testing environment, setting up drivers (if applicable), and handling pre-test configurations.

2. **Common Functions**: The "Base Test" may include common functions or utilities used in multiple test cases, such as logging in, navigating to specific pages, or interacting with elements.

3. **Test Cleanup**: After each test case execution, any necessary cleanup is performed to leave the environment in a consistent state for the next test.

# ContactTest.java Description

## Overview
`ContactTest.java` is a Java test class within our automation framework that focuses on testing the contact-related functionalities of our application. This class contains a suite of test methods designed to validate the correctness and reliability of features related to managing and interacting with contacts.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of `ContactTest.java` is to:
- Ensure that the contact-related features of our application work as intended.
- Detect and report any issues or anomalies related to contacts.
- Provide a comprehensive suite of test cases for verifying the correctness of contact management functionalities.

## Key Features
1. **Contact Creation Tests**: This includes test methods that verify the creation of new contacts, including data validation and storage.

2. **Contact Update Tests**: Test methods that ensure the ability to update contact information and verify that changes are correctly saved.

3. **Contact Deletion Tests**: Validation of the removal of contacts from the application, checking for proper data deletion.

4. **Contact List Tests**: Tests that validate the correct display and ordering of contact lists.

5. **Contact Search Tests**: Verification of the search functionality for finding specific contacts.

6. **Contact Interaction Tests**: Tests for interactions with contacts, such as sending messages or making calls.

7. **Error Handling Tests**: Checking how the application handles errors, such as when attempting to interact with a non-existent contact.
